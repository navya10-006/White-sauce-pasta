So, this is basically a youtube recipe we tryied and then later experimented on. You can't find this recipe anywere else which meanes that this is a original and does have a copy right. But you can try it if you want but just in case not everyone likes but me and my mom can literally live on it. So, try on your own risk.

// ON THE EDGE OF GREAT
running from the past 
tripping on the now
what is lost can be found, its obvious
and like a rubber ball 
we come bouncing back 
we all got a second act inside of us

I believe 
I believe 
that we are just one dream 
away from who we are meant to be 
that we are standing on the edge of 
something big, something crazy 
our best days is yet unknown 
that this moment is ours to own 
that we standing on the edge of great
on the edge of great
great
on the edge of great 
great
on the edge of graet 
that we are standing on the edge of... 
great

we all make mistakes 
but they are just stepping stones 
to take us were we wanna go 
its never straight, no

sometimes we gotta lean
lean on someone else 
to get a little help
until we find our way

I believe 
I believe 
that we are just one dream
