// FINALLY FREE
hearts on fire 
we are no liars 
so we say what we wanna say
I awakened 
no more faking 
so we pushed all our fears away
don't know if I'll make it
cause I am falling under
close my eyes and fell my chest
beating like thunder
I.. wanna flyy.. come alive... watch me shine...

I got a spark in me 
hand up if u can see 
and you're a part of me
hands up if you're me 
now till eternity
hands up if you beleive
been so long and now we are finally free..
we're all bright now 
what a sight now
coming out like were fireworks
marching on proud
turn it up loud 
cause now we know what we're worth
we know we can make it cause we are not falling under
close my eyes and feel my chest
beating like thunder
I wanna flyy.. come alive.. watch me shine....
I got a spark in me 
hands up if you can see 
and now you're part of me
hands up if you're with me
