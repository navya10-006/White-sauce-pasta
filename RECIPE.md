RECIPE
1. Take some raw pasta in a microwave bowl add some water and 2 tea spoon oil and microwave it for 10 mins.
2. Take a kadhai(don't know what's it called in english) place it on the stove on medium flame and add some ghee.
3. When the ghee melts add some maida and mix it. Cook it till it become of some sort of reddish or brownish colour light not dark. We dont want to burn it.
4. [This is an optional step] [execute only if want veges] Take out the contents of the kadhai in a bowl and cool down. Now add some more ghee to the kadhai and heat the vegetable you may have cut.
5. Now take the maida mix and some milk to it and mix it using a spoon, ensure there are no lumps. 
6. When done pour the contents back in the kadhai( store the vegetables somewhere else for a while) fire the flame and add some more milk to it. Then add the cheese(grated)[don't need much just like a small bowl or something], salt, pasta, oregano, chilli flakes and the vegetables. Mix it nicely and ensure that all the cheese has melted.
7. Your pasta is ready to eat.

P.S No measurements are given because we usually just do it with hit and trial(well only I do it with hit and trial my mom doesn't need to try) and just go with a average amount after that all you need is some good luck.

//(in hopes that you will read it last or even if you read it at all)I was trying to write my motive over here(nothing which maybe anything useful, you may even want to save you time and skip this) but then that turned out to be pretty huge so I deleted it all. I know I have wasted a lot of your time and am still doing so you may want to do something more useful because apparently when I look back at my project I have a lot of time in my hands, unlike most of the people on this earth. So thanks for reading(don't I sound like those youtubers when they at last are asking to subscribe and all!!)

//Well anyway. Byeee  ;)
